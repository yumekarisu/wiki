=== SELECTION SORT ===

Selection sort is one of the basic sorting algorithm in computer science.
It is slower than Quicksort and has Big O Notation of O(n^2)

#### How it works
1. start from the beginning as the smallest number
2. compare the smallest number with the next number
3. if the compared number is smaller than the current smallest number, change the smallest number to the compared number
4. when the end is reached, add the smallest number to the sorted array, then repeat again till all the value is sorted
